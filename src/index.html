					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<h2>Hi, my name is Denzel and I'm an aspiring front-end developer.</h2>
					<p>I'm a curious and creative thinker with a background in science and a growing passion for web development.</p>
					<p>
						I studied to become a biology medical lab analyst and have worked in that field for nearly two years. While I've enjoyed the precision and problem-solving in the lab, I've
						always had a strong interest in computers and technology — and over time, that interest grew into something more.
					</p>
					<p>
						After exploring different programming paths, I found front-end development to be the perfect match — blending logic, design, and creativity. I enjoy building interactive,
						user-friendly websites and bringing them to life with clean, maintainable code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since December 2024, I've been learning front-end development through The Odin Project, a well-known open-source curriculum. I've dedicated about an hour each day after work to
						mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Webpack — and building real projects along the way.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm now ready to take the next step — whether through a traineeship or a junior front-end role — where I can contribute, continue learning, and grow within a professional
						development team.
